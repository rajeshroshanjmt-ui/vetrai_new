If you are running Vetrai Desktop on Windows, you must [enable Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#activate-developer-mode) to use the Docling components.
The location of this setting depends on your Windows OS version.
Find **For developers** in your Windows Settings, or search for "Developer" in the Windows search bar, and then enable **Developer mode**.
You might need to restart your computer or Vetrai to apply the change.
