`uvx` is included with `uv` in the Vetrai package.

To use `npx` server commands, you must first install an LTS release of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). If you run Vetrai in Docker, install Node.js inside the container image and rebuild so that `npx`-based MCP servers are available at runtime. For more information, see [Package management](/develop-application#package-management).

For an example of an `npx` MCP server in Vetrai, see [Connect an Astra DB MCP server to Vetrai](/mcp-component-astra).
