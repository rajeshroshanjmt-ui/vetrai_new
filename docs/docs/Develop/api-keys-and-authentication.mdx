:::warning
Never expose Vetrai ports directly to the internet without proper security measures.
Set `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=False`, use a non-default `VETRAI_SECRET_KEY`, and deploy your Vetrai server behind a reverse proxy with authentication enabled.
For more information, see [Start a Vetrai server with authentication enabled](#start-a-vetrai-server-with-authentication-enabled).
:::

Authentication credentials help prevent unauthorized access to your Vetrai server, flows, and services connected through components.

There are three types of credentials that you use in Vetrai:

* [Vetrai API keys](#vetrai-api-keys): For authentication with the Vetrai API and authorizing server-side Vetrai actions like running flows and uploading files.
* [Component API keys](#component-api-keys): For authentication between Vetrai and a service connected through a component, such as a model provider or third-party API.
* [Authentication environment variables](#authentication-environment-variables): These environment variables configure how Vetrai handles user authentication and authorization.

## Vetrai API keys {#vetrai-api-keys}

You can use Vetrai API keys to interact with Vetrai programmatically.

By default, most Vetrai API endpoints, such as `/v1/run/$FLOW_ID`, require authentication with a Vetrai API key.

Vetrai validates API keys against keys stored in the database, but you can configure Vetrai to validate API keys against an environment variable instead.
For more information, see [`VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE`](#vetrai-api-key-source).

To require API key authentication for flow webhook endpoints, use the [`VETRAI_WEBHOOK_AUTH_ENABLE`](/webhook#require-authentication-for-webhooks) environment variable.
To configure authentication for Vetrai MCP servers, see [Use Vetrai as an MCP server](/mcp-server).

### Vetrai API key permissions

A Vetrai API key adopts the privileges of the user who created it.
This means that API keys you create have the same permissions and access that you do, including access to your flows, components, and Vetrai database.
A Vetrai API key cannot be used to access resources outside of your own Vetrai server.

In single-user environments, you are always a superuser, and your Vetrai API keys always have superuser privileges.

In multi-user environments, users who aren't superusers cannot use their API keys to access other users' resources.
Superusers can only run their own flows, and cannot run flows owned by other users.
You must [start your Vetrai server with authentication enabled](#start-a-vetrai-server-with-authentication-enabled) to allow superusers to manage users and create non-superuser accounts.

### Create a Vetrai API key

You can generate a Vetrai API key in your Vetrai **Settings** or with the Vetrai CLI.

The CLI option is required if your Vetrai server is running in `--backend-only` mode.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="settings" label="Vetrai Settings" default>

1. In the Vetrai header, click your profile icon, and then select **Settings**.
2. Click **Vetrai API Keys**, and then click **Add New**.
3. Name your key, and then click **Create API Key**.
4. Copy the API key and store it securely.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Vetrai CLI" label="Vetrai CLI">

If you're serving your flow with `--backend-only=true`, you can't create API keys in your Vetrai **Settings** because the frontend isn't running.
In this case, you must create API keys with the Vetrai CLI.

1. Recommended: [Start your Vetrai server with authentication enabled](#start-a-vetrai-server-with-authentication-enabled).

    The Vetrai team recommends enabling authentication for security reasons to prevent unauthorized creation of API keys and superusers, especially in production environments.
    If authentication isn't enabled (`VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=True`), all users are effectively superusers, and they can create API keys with the Vetrai CLI.

2. Create an API key with [`vetrai api-key`](/configuration-cli#vetrai-api-key):

    ```shell
    uv run vetrai api-key
    ```

    All API keys created with the Vetrai CLI have superuser privileges because the command requires superuser authentication, and Vetrai API keys adopt the privileges of the user who created them.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use a Vetrai API key

To authenticate Vetrai API requests, pass your Vetrai API key an `x-api-key` header or query parameter.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="header" label="HTTP header" default>

```shell
curl -X POST \
  "http://$VETRAI_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID?stream=false" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $VETRAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"inputs": {"text":""}, "tweaks": {}}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="parameter" label="Query parameter">

```shell
curl -X POST \
  "http://$VETRAI_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID?x-api-key=$VETRAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"inputs": {"text":""}, "tweaks": {}}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For more information about forming Vetrai API requests, see [Get started with the Vetrai API](/api-reference-api-examples) and [Trigger flows with the Vetrai API](/concepts-publish).

### Track API key usage

By default, Vetrai tracks API key usage through `total_uses` and `last_used_at` records in your [Vetrai database](/memory).

To disable API key tracking, set `VETRAI_DISABLE_TRACK_APIKEY_USAGE=True` in your [Vetrai environment variables](/environment-variables).
This can help avoid database contention during periods of high concurrency.

### Revoke an API key

To revoke and delete an API key, do the following:

1. In the Vetrai header, click your profile icon, and then select **Settings**.
2. Click **Vetrai API Keys**.
3. Select the keys you want to delete, and then click <Icon name="Trash2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Delete**.

This action immediately invalidates the key and prevents it from being used again.

## Component API keys {#component-api-keys}

Component API keys authorize access to external services that are called by components in your flows, such as model providers, databases, or third-party APIs.
These aren't Vetrai API keys or general application credentials.

In Vetrai, you can store component API keys in global variables in your **Settings** or import them from your runtime environment.
For more information, see [Global variables](/configuration-global-variables).

You create and manage component API keys within the service provider's platform.
Vetrai only stores the encrypted key value or a secure reference to a key stored elsewhere; it doesn't manage the actual credentials at the source.
This means that deleting a global variable from Vetrai doesn't delete or invalidate the actual API key in the service provider's system.
You must delete or rotate component API keys directly using the service provider's interface or API.

For added security, you can set `VETRAI_REMOVE_API_KEYS=True` to omit API keys and tokens from flow data in your [Vetrai database](/memory).
Additionally, when [exporting flows](/concepts-flows-import), you can choose to omit API keys from the exported flow JSON.

## Authentication environment variables

This section describes the available authentication configuration variables.

You can use the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/vetrai-ai/vetrai/blob/main/.env.example) file in the Vetrai repository as a template for your own `.env` file.

### VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN {#vetrai-auto-login}

This variable controls whether authentication is required to access your Vetrai server, including the visual editor, API, and Vetrai CLI:

* If `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=False`, automatic login is disabled. Users must sign in to the visual editor, authenticate as a superuser to run certain Vetrai CLI commands, and use a Vetrai API key for Vetrai API requests.
If `false`, the Vetrai team recommends that you also explicitly set [`VETRAI_SUPERUSER` and `VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`](#vetrai-superuser) to avoid using the insecure default values.

* If `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=True` (default), all API requests require authentication with a Vetrai API key, but the visual editor automatically signs in all users as superusers, and Vetrai uses _only_ the default [superuser credentials](/api-keys-and-authentication#vetrai-superuser).
All users access the same visual editor environment without password protection, they can run all Vetrai CLI commands as superusers, and Vetrai automatically authenticates internal requests between the backend and frontend based on the users' superuser privileges.
If you also want to bypass authentication for Vetrai API requests in addition to other bypassed authentication, see [`VETRAI_SKIP_AUTH_AUTO_LOGIN`](/api-keys-and-authentication#vetrai-skip-auth-auto-login).

Vetrai doesn't allow users to simultaneously edit the same flow in real time.
If two users edit the same flow, Vetrai saves only the work of the most recent editor based on the state of that user's [workspace](/concepts-overview#workspace). Any changes made by the other user in the interim are overwritten.

#### Default authentication enforcement and VETRAI_SKIP_AUTH_AUTO_LOGIN {#vetrai-skip-auth-auto-login}

In Vetrai version 1.6, the default settings are `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=True` and `VETRAI_SKIP_AUTH_AUTO_LOGIN=False`.
This enforces authentication for API requests only, as explained in the preceding section.

For temporary backwards compatibility, you can revert to the fully unauthenticated behavior from earlier versions by setting both variables to `true`.
However, a future release will set `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=False` and remove `VETRAI_SKIP_AUTH_AUTO_LOGIN`.
At that point, Vetrai will strictly enforce API key authentication for API requests, and you can manually disable authentication for some features, like the visual editor, by setting `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=True`.

<details>
<summary>Authentication enforcement in earlier versions</summary>

Vetrai version 1.5 was the first version that could enforce authentication for Vetrai API requests, regardless of the value of `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN`.
As a temporary bypass for backwards compatibility, this version added the `VETRAI_SKIP_AUTH_AUTO_LOGIN` environment variable and set both variables to `true` by default to preserve the fully unauthenticated behavior from earlier versions.
This allowed users to upgrade to version 1.5 with no change in the authentication behavior.

In Vetrai versions earlier than 1.5, Vetrai API requests didn't require authentication.
Additionally, the default setting of `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=True` automatically granted all users superuser privileges in the visual editor, and it allowed all users to run all Vetrai CLI commands as superusers.
</details>

### VETRAI_ENABLE_SUPERUSER_CLI {#vetrai-enable-superuser-cli}

Controls the availability of the `vetrai superuser` command in the Vetrai CLI.
The default is `true`, but `false` is recommended to prevent unrestricted superuser creation.
For more information, see [`vetrai superuser`](/configuration-cli#vetrai-superuser).

### VETRAI_SUPERUSER and VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD {#vetrai-superuser}

These variables specify the username and password for the Vetrai server's superuser.

```text
VETRAI_SUPERUSER=administrator
VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=securepassword
```

They are required if `VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=False`.
Otherwise, they aren't relevant.

When you [start a Vetrai server with authentication enabled](#start-a-vetrai-server-with-authentication-enabled), if these variables are required but _not_ set, then Vetrai uses the default values of `vetrai` and `vetrai`.
These defaults don't apply when using the Vetrai CLI command [`vetrai superuser`](/configuration-cli#vetrai-superuser).

### VETRAI_SECRET_KEY {#vetrai-secret-key}

This environment variable stores a secret key used for encrypting sensitive data like API keys.
Vetrai uses the [Fernet](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library for secret key encryption.

If no secret key is provided, Vetrai automatically generates one.

However, you should generate and explicitly set your own key in production environments.
This is particularly important for multi-instance deployments like Kubernetes to ensure consistent encryption across instances.

To generate a secret encryption key for `VETRAI_SECRET_KEY`, do the following:

1. Run the command to generate and copy a secret to the clipboard.

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="unix" label="macOS or Linux">

    * **macOS**: Generate a secret key and copy it to the clipboard:

        ```bash
        python3 -c "from secrets import token_urlsafe; print(f'VETRAI_SECRET_KEY={token_urlsafe(32)}')" | pbcopy
        ```

    * **Linux**: Generate a secret key and copy it to the clipboard:

        ```bash
        python3 -c "from secrets import token_urlsafe; print(f'VETRAI_SECRET_KEY={token_urlsafe(32)}')" | xclip -selection clipboard
        ```

    * **Unix**: Generate a secret key and print it to the terminal to manually copy it:

        ```bash
        python3 -c "from secrets import token_urlsafe; print(f'VETRAI_SECRET_KEY={token_urlsafe(32)}')"
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

    * Generate a secret key and copy it to the clipboard:

        ```bash
        python -c "from secrets import token_urlsafe; print(f'VETRAI_SECRET_KEY={token_urlsafe(32)}')"
        ```

    * Generate a secret key and print it to the terminal to manually copy it:

        ```bash

        # Or just print
        python -c "from secrets import token_urlsafe; print(f'VETRAI_SECRET_KEY={token_urlsafe(32)}')"
        ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Paste the value into your `.env` file:

    ```text
    VETRAI_SECRET_KEY=dBuu...2kM2_fb
    ```

    If you're running Vetrai on Docker, reference the `VETRAI_SECRET_KEY` from your `.env` file in the `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

        ```yaml
        environment:
          - VETRAI_SECRET_KEY=${VETRAI_SECRET_KEY}
        ```

### VETRAI_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE {#vetrai-new-user-is-active}

When `VETRAI_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE=False` (default), accounts created by superusers are inactive by default and must be explicitly activated before users can sign in to the visual editor.
The superuser can also deactivate a user's account as needed.

When `VETRAI_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE=True`, accounts created by superusers are automatically activated.

```text
VETRAI_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE=False
```

Only superusers can manage user accounts for a Vetrai server, but user management only matters if your server has authentication enabled.
For more information, see [Start a Vetrai server with authentication enabled](#start-a-vetrai-server-with-authentication-enabled).

### VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE {#vetrai-api-key-source}

This variable controls how Vetrai validates API keys.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `db` (default) | Validates API keys against [Vetrai API keys](#vetrai-api-keys) stored in the database. This is the standard behavior where users create and manage API keys through the Vetrai UI or CLI. |
| `env` | Validates API keys against the `VETRAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Useful for Kubernetes deployments, CI/CD pipelines, or any environment where you want to inject a pre-defined API key without database configuration. |

By default, Vetrai validates the `x-api-key` header against the Vetrai database with `VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE=db`.
When using database-based validation, you can create multiple keys with per-user permissions, track usage, and manage keys through the Vetrai UI or CLI.

When `VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE=env`, Vetrai validates the `x-api-key` header against the value of the `VETRAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
This means Vetrai runs securely in stateless environments, such as with LFX or Kubernetes secrets.

When `VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE=env`, only a single API key can be used for the deployment. All authenticated requests use the same API key, and successful authentication grants superuser privileges.
This mode is designed for single-tenant deployments or automated systems, not multi-user environments where different users need different access levels. To rotate your keys, update the environment variable and restart the Vetrai server.

To enable environment-based API key validation:

1. In the Vetrai `.env` file, set the API key source to `env`:

    ```text
    VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE=env
    ```

2. In the Vetrai `.env` file, set the API key value:

    ```text
    VETRAI_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
    ```

3. Use the API key in your requests:

    ```shell
    curl -X POST \
      "http://VETRAI_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/FLOW_ID?stream=false" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: VETRAI_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"inputs": {"text":""}, "tweaks": {}}'
    ```

    Replace `VETRAI_SERVER_ADDRESS`, `FLOW_ID`, and `VETRAI_API_KEY` with the values from your deployment.

<details>
<summary>Kubernetes deployment example</summary>

To configure an environment-based API key in a Kubernetes Secret, do the following:

1. Create a Kubernetes Secret with your API key:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: vetrai-api-key
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      api-key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the `VETRAI_API_KEY` value from the Vetrai `.env` file.

2. Reference the `vetrai-api-key` Secret in your Kubernetes deployment:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: vetrai
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: vetrai
            image: vetraiai/vetrai:latest
            env:
            - name: VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE
              value: "env"
            - name: VETRAI_API_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: vetrai-api-key
                  key: api-key
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker Compose example</summary>

To configure an environment-based API key in Docker Compose, do the following:

1. Set the API key in your Vetrai `.env` file.

    ```text
    VETRAI_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Vetrai API key value.

2. Create or update your `docker-compose.yml` file to set `VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE=env` and reference the `VETRAI_API_KEY`.

    ```yaml
    services:
      vetrai:
        image: vetraiai/vetrai:latest
        environment:
          - VETRAI_API_KEY_SOURCE=env
          - VETRAI_API_KEY=${VETRAI_API_KEY}
        ports:
          - "7860:7860"
    ```

</details>

### VETRAI_CORS_* {#cors-configuration-for-authentication}

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration controls how authentication credentials are handled when your Vetrai frontend and backend are served from different origins.
The following `VETRAI_CORS_*` environment variables are available:

| Variable | Format | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` | Boolean | `True` | Whether to allow credentials, such as cookies and authorization headers, in CORS requests. |
| `VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS` | List[String] or String | `*` | The allowed headers for CORS requests. Provide a comma-separated list of headers or use `*` to allow all headers. |
| `VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_METHODS` | List[String] or String | `*` | The allowed HTTP methods for CORS requests. Provide a comma-separated list of methods or use `*` to allow all methods. |
| `VETRAI_CORS_ORIGINS` | String | `*` | The allowed CORS origins. Provide a comma-separated list of origins or use `*` for all origins. |

The default configuration enables CORS credentials and uses wildcards (`*`) to allow all origins, headers, and methods:

```text
VETRAI_CORS_ORIGINS=*
VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=True
VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS=*
VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_METHODS=*
```

:::danger
Vetrai's default CORS settings can be a security risk in production environments because any website can make requests to your Vetrai API, and any website can include credentials in cross-origin requests, including authentication cookies and authorization headers.

In production deployments, specify exact origins in `VETRAI_CORS_ORIGINS`.
You can also specify allowed headers and methods, if needed.
For example:

```text
VETRAI_CORS_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com","https://app.yourdomain.com"]
VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=True
VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS=["Content-Type","Authorization"]
VETRAI_CORS_ALLOW_METHODS=["GET","POST","PUT"]
```
:::

### SSRF protection {#ssrf-protection}

The following environment variables configure Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) protection for the [**API Request** component](/api-request).
SSRF protection prevents requests to internal or private network resources, such as private IP ranges, loopback addresses, and cloud metadata endpoints.

| Variable | Format | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `VETRAI_SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` | Boolean | `False` | Enable SSRF protection for the **API Request** component. When enabled, the component blocks requests to private IP addresses. When disabled, requests are not blocked. |
| `VETRAI_SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | List[String] | Not set | A comma-separated list of allowed hosts, IP addresses, or CIDR ranges that can bypass SSRF protection checks. For example: `192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.5,*.internal.company.local`.|

### VETRAI_WEBHOOK_AUTH_ENABLE {#vetrai-webhook-auth-enable}

This variable controls whether API key authentication is required for webhook endpoints.

| Variable | Format | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `VETRAI_WEBHOOK_AUTH_ENABLE` | Boolean | `False` | When `True`, webhook endpoints require API key authentication and validate that the authenticated user owns the flow being executed. When `False`, no Vetrai API key is required and all requests to the webhook endpoint are treated as being sent by the flow owner. |

By default, webhooks run as the flow owner without authentication with `VETRAI_WEBHOOK_AUTH_ENABLE=False`.

To require API key authentication for webhooks, in your Vetrai `.env` file, set `VETRAI_WEBHOOK_AUTH_ENABLE=True`.

When webhook authentication is enabled, you must provide a Vetrai API key with each webhook request as an HTTP header or query parameter. For more information, see [Require authentication for webhooks](/webhook#require-authentication-for-webhooks).

## Start a Vetrai server with authentication enabled

This section shows you how to use the [authentication environment variables](/api-keys-and-authentication#authentication-environment-variables) to deploy a Vetrai server with authentication enabled.
This involves disabling automatic login, setting superuser credentials, generating a secret encryption key, and enabling user management.

This configuration is recommended for any deployment where Vetrai is exposed to a shared or public network, or where multiple users access the same Vetrai server.

With authentication enabled, all users must sign in to the visual editor with valid credentials, and API requests require authentication with a Vetrai API key.
Additionally, you must sign in as a superuser to manage users and [create a Vetrai API key](#create-a-vetrai-api-key) with superuser privileges.

### Start the Vetrai server

1. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

    ```text
    VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=False
    VETRAI_SUPERUSER=
    VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=
    VETRAI_SECRET_KEY=
    VETRAI_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE=False
    VETRAI_ENABLE_SUPERUSER_CLI=False
    ```

    Your `.env` file can have other environment variables.
    This example focuses on authentication variables.

2. Set `VETRAI_SUPERUSER` and `VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` to your desired superuser credentials.

    For a one-time test, you can use basic credentials like `administrator` and `password`.
    Strong, securely-stored credentials are recommended in genuine development and production environments.

3. Recommended: Generate and set a `VETRAI_SECRET_KEY` for encrypting sensitive data.

    If you don't set a secret key, Vetrai generates one automatically, but this isn't recommended for production environments.

    For instructions on generating and setting a secret key, see [`VETRAI_SECRET_KEY`](#vetrai-secret-key).

4. Save your `.env` file with the populated variables. For example:

    ```text
    VETRAI_AUTO_LOGIN=False
    VETRAI_SUPERUSER=administrator
    VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=securepassword
    VETRAI_SECRET_KEY=dBuu...2kM2_fb
    VETRAI_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE=False
    VETRAI_ENABLE_SUPERUSER_CLI=False
    ```

5. Start Vetrai with the configuration from your `.env` file:

    ```text
    uv run vetrai run --env-file .env
    ```

    Starting Vetrai with a `.env` file automatically authenticates you as the superuser set in `VETRAI_SUPERUSER` and `VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`.
    If you don't explicitly set these variables, the default values are `vetrai` and `vetrai` for system auto-login.

6. Verify the server is running. The default location is `http://localhost:7860`.

Next, you can add users to your Vetrai server to collaborate with others on flows.

### Manage users as an administrator

1. To complete your first-time login as a superuser, go to `http://localhost:7860/login`.

    If you aren't using the default location, replace `localhost:7860` with your server's address.

2. Log in with the superuser credentials you set in your `.env` (`VETRAI_SUPERUSER` and `VETRAI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`).

3. To manage users on your server, navigate to `/admin`, such as `http://localhost:7860/admin`, click your profile icon, and then click **Admin Page**.

    As a superuser, you can add users, set permissions, reset passwords, and delete accounts.

4. To add a user, click **New User**, and then complete the user account form:

    1. Enter a username and password.
    2. To activate the account immediately, select **Active**. Inactive users cannot sign in or access flows they created before becoming inactive.
    3. Deselect **Superuser** if you don't want the user to have full administrative privileges.
    4. Click **Save**. The new user appears in the **Admin Page**.

5. Send the credentials to the user so they can sign in to Vetrai. The superuser sets the initial password when creating the account, so users must receive their login credentials from the superuser.

6. To test the new user's access, sign out of Vetrai, and then sign in with the new user's credentials.

    Try to access the `/admin` page.
    You are redirected to the `/flows` page if the new user isn't a superuser.
