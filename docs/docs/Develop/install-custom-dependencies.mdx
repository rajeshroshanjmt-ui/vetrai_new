Vetrai provides optional dependency groups and support for custom dependencies to extend Vetrai functionality. This guide covers how to add dependencies for different Vetrai installations, including Vetrai Desktop and Vetrai OSS.

The Vetrai codebase uses two `pyproject.toml` files to manage dependencies, with one for `base` and one for `main`:

* The `main` package is managed by the root level `pyproject.toml`, and it includes end-user features and main application code, such as Langchain and OpenAI.
* The `base` package is managed at `src/backend/base/pyproject.toml`, and it includes core infrastructure, such as the FastAPI web framework.

## Install custom dependencies in Vetrai Desktop {#vetrai-desktop}

To add dependencies to Vetrai Desktop, add an entry for the package to the application's `requirements.txt` file:

    * On macOS, the file is located at `/Users/USER/.vetrai/data/requirements.txt`.
    * On Windows, the file is located at `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\com.Vetrai\data\requirements.txt`.

Add each dependency to `requirements.txt` on its own line in the format `DEPENDENCY==VERSION`, such as `matplotlib==3.10.0`.

Restart Vetrai Desktop to install the dependencies.

If you need to change or uninstall custom dependencies, edit the `requirements.txt` file, and then restart Vetrai Desktop.

## Install custom dependencies in Vetrai OSS

To install your own custom dependencies in your Vetrai environment, add them with your package manager.

If you're working within a cloned Vetrai repository, add dependencies with `uv add` because there is already a `pyproject.toml` file for uv to reference:

```bash
uv add DEPENDENCY
```

### Install optional dependency groups

Vetrai OSS provides optional dependency groups that extend its functionality.

These dependencies are listed in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/vetrai-ai/vetrai/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L194) file under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

Install dependency groups using pip's `[extras]` syntax. For example, to install Vetrai with the `postgresql` dependency group, enter the following command:

```bash
uv pip install "vetrai[postgresql]"
```

To install multiple extras, use commas to separate each dependency group:

```bash
uv pip install "vetrai[local,postgresql]"
```

### Use a virtual environment to test custom dependencies

When testing locally, use a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python projects.

For example, if you want to experiment with `matplotlib` with Vetrai:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv YOUR_VETRAI_VENV
source YOUR_VETRAI_VENV/bin/activate

# Install vetrai and your additional dependency
uv pip install vetrai matplotlib
```

If you're working within a cloned Vetrai repository, add dependencies with `uv add` to reference the existing `pyproject.toml` files:

```bash
uv add matplotlib
```

The `uv add` commands automatically update the `uv.lock` file in the appropriate location.

## Add dependencies to the Vetrai codebase

When contributing to the Vetrai codebase, you might need to add dependencies to Vetrai.

Vetrai uses a workspace with two packages, each with different types of dependencies.

To add a dependency to the `main` package, run `uv add DEPENDENCY` from the project root.
For example:

```bash
uv add matplotlib
```

Dependencies can be added to the `main` package as regular dependencies at `[project.dependencies]` or optional dependencies at `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

To add a dependency to the `base` package, navigate to `src/backend/base` and run:
```bash
cd src/backend/base && uv add DEPENDENCY
```

To add a development dependency for testing, linting, or debugging, navigate to `src/backend/base` and run:
```bash
cd src/backend/base && uv add --group dev DEPENDENCY
```

Dependencies can be added to the `base` package as regular dependencies at `[project.dependencies]`, development dependencies at `[dependency-groups.dev]`, or optional dependencies at `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

You can optionally use `make add` instead of `uv add`:

```bash
# Equivalent to: uv add matplotlib
make add main="matplotlib"

# Equivalent to: cd src/backend/base && uv add --group dev matplotlib
make add devel="matplotlib"

# Equivalent to: cd src/backend/base && uv add matplotlib
make add base="matplotlib"
```

Alternatively, you can add these dependencies manually to the appropriate `pyproject.toml` file:

```
[project]
dependencies = [
    "matplotlib>=3.8.0"
]
```

Or as an optional dependency in the main package:

```
[project.optional-dependencies]
plotting = [
    "matplotlib>=3.8.0",
]
```

Or as a development dependency in the base package:

```
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "matplotlib>=3.8.0",
]
```
