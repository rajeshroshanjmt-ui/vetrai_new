This guide explains how to [deploy Vetrai on Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=vetrai), a cloud infrastructure platform that provides auto-deploy, managed databases, and automatic scaling.

1. Create a Railway account.

   A Hobby account on Railway is sufficient for Vetrai's dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM requirements. For more information, see [Railway pricing](https://railway.com/pricing?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=vetrai).

2. Follow this link to deploy the Vetrai template on Railway:

3. Optional: Add any custom configuration for your Vetrai deployment.

   The Vetrai Railway template automatically sets up the infrastructure, deploys Vetrai, and then starts the application.

4. Wait for the deployment to complete.

5. Navigate to your Vetrai instance at your deployment's public URL, such as `https://APP-NAME.up.railway.app`.
