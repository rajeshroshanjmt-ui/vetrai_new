Vetrai's **Agent** component is critical for building agent flows.
This component defines the behavior and capabilities of AI agents in your flows.

<PartialAgentsWork />

## Examples of agent flows

For examples of flows using the **Agent** component, see the following:

* [Vetrai quickstart](/get-started-quickstart): Start with the **Simple Agent** template, modify its tools, and then learn how to use an agent flow in an application.

    The **Simple Agent** template creates a basic agent flow with an **Agent** component that can use two other Vetrai components as tools.
    The LLM specified in the **Agent** component's settings can use its own built-in functionality as well as the functionality provided by the connected tools when generating responses.

* [Use an agent as a tool](/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool): Create a multi-agent flow.

* [Use Vetrai as an MCP client](/mcp-client) and [Use Vetrai as an MCP server](/mcp-server): Use the **Agent** and [**MCP Tools** component](/mcp-tools) to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in your flows.

## Agent component {#agent-component}

The **Agent** component is the primary agent actor in your agent flows.
This component uses an LLM integration to respond to input, such as a chat message or file upload.

The agent can use the tools already available in the base LLM as well as additional tools that you connect to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
You can connect any Vetrai component as a tool, including other **Agent** components and MCP servers through the [**MCP Tools** component](/mcp-tools).

For more information about using this component, see [Use Vetrai agents](/agents).
